	  	  <h4>Welcome to Simple Web Solutions</h4>	
	  	  <p>
	  	  	Firstly, thank you for visiting. If you are here, it is likely that you are a small business owner, tradesperson, or have a unique service or brand that you would like to market. You may be interested in getting your first website, changing over your website to a more modern format, or are wondering if you even need a website.

	  	  <h4>Do You Need a Website?</h4>	
	  	  <p>
  	  	  Rest assured, I am here to help you through every step of the process. If you decide that you have no need for a website, that's fine too. The good news is, I can begin helping you right here, and now. First, let's see why a website might help you. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicoleleinbachreyhle/2014/09/29/websites-for-small-businesses/#54f9cdfe2026
">Here</a> is a brief article by Forbes that highlights some key reasons as to how a website can help your business. </p>

	  	  <h4>What is Responsive Design?</h4>	
	  	  <p>
	  	  	All finished, and ready for more? Great! Let's keep going! The web has seen numerous changes over the years. One such change is called "responsive design". If you haven't heard of it, don't worry. I am here to help. Responsive design, put simply, allows your website to be displayed in a concise manner across several different electronic devices. This means that one site can be easily accessed on PCs, tablets, and smartphones, to help you reach a broader audience. This <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/why-responsive-design-support-is-the-most-important-feature-you-can-add-to-your-website.html">article</a> lists a few reasons why you may want to choose a responsive design for your site.

	  	  <h4>Web Accessibility</h4>	
	  	  <p>
	  	  	Lastly, I would like to take a moment to address web accessibility. Certain disabilities can inhibit a user's ability to navigate through your website. Low contrast colors can be difficult for those with varying types of color blindness to read the text on your site. Certain neurological disorders and injuries to the hand can render a user incapable of using a mouse; which can make it difficult to navigate between links on your site. Those with severly impared vision, or those without the ability to see rely on screen readers to read the text out loud to them. This requires a special kind of text within the site for the screen readers to access. 
	  	  	
	  	  	If you would like to learn more about web accessibility, follow this link <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">here</a>. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is responsible for setting web standards. The WCAG 2.0 standard was devised by the W3C as a guideline for making sites accessible to those with disabilities.

	  	  <h4>In Closing</h4>	
	  	  <p>
	  	  	Now that we've gone over some of the finer points the web, I hope that I've helped you decide if a website is right for you. If the answer is "yes", you may view my available services <a href="services.html">here</a>.
